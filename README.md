## The Problem: The Agentic Shift

E-commerce is undergoing a massive, two-front disruption that is dismantling the last two decades of industry standards:

1. **The Conversational Migration:** Consumer shopping is rapidly migrating from traditional website storefronts to conversational interfaces inside Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, and Claude.
2. **The Platform Black Box:** Legacy e-commerce platforms are transforming into closed, fully automated black boxes to sell "convenience" directly to merchants.

This raises an existential question: **Where does the custom e-commerce developer fit when the platform becomes autonomous and the storefront becomes a chat window?**

---

## The Solution: Become the Orchestrator

Goofre elevates developers from mere integrators to true **Agentic Commerce Orchestrators**.

Acting as a high-performance switchboard, Goofre wires directly into the massive infrastructure of Google’s business and commerce solutions—the underlying foundation of the Unified Commerce Protocol (UCP). It enables you to orchestrate agentic commerce workflows without any reliance on third-party e-commerce platforms or website builders.

With Goofre, you own the infrastructure. You can bundle, optimize, and deliver AI-native commerce and marketing services directly to your merchants, entirely on your terms.

### How It Works: Harnessing the Google Stack

Google Search, Chrome, and Gemini serve billions of active users daily, making them the ultimate discovery and conversion engines. Goofre leverages this by turning Google Merchant Center (GMC) into your core Product Information Management (PIM) and orchestration hub.

- **One-Way Data Synchronization:** Goofre seamlessly syncs raw SKU and catalog data from legacy e-commerce platforms directly into GMC.
- **Intelligent Diagnostics:** The orchestrator autonomously identifies, flags, and brings your attention to critical feed issues or policy violations within GMC so you can fix them proactively.
- **Full-Spectrum Orchestration:** Beyond the catalog, Goofre orchestrates the merchant's entire agentic lifecycle—powering dynamic advertising, sales optimization, automated customer service, and real-time inventory management directly through Google's unified ecosystem.

## ⚡ The Two-Minute Quick Start

```bash
npx create-goofre-ucp my-commerce-layer
cd my-commerce-layer
npm start
```

_Your admin dashboard is now configured to run at `http://localhost:3000/admin`._

The setup comes with a local zero-dependency SQLite database out-of-the-box, automatically seeded with mock customers, products, and orders. Additionally, `create-goofre-ucp` registers `MockPaymentGateway` and `MockEmailSender` plugins so you can immediately begin building and testing complex Agentic Webhooks.

## The Goofre Manifesto: Engineering Sovereignty

We believe that e-commerce developers are the true architects of modern retail. Goofre exists to grant them absolute technical sovereignty.

1. **We build orchestrators, not platforms.** We do not dictate where your data lives; we give you the power to command it.
2. **True Independence.** We empower developers to become independent orchestrators, delivering platform-free, AI-native commerce experiences directly to their merchants.
3. **Agent-First Architecture.** The future of commerce is agentic. We provide the robust, Google-stack-powered infrastructure necessary to build systems that act, decide, and optimize autonomously.
4. **No Vendor Lock-In.** Your merchants' data, workflows, and logic belong to them, orchestrated by you.

Build without boundaries. Orchestrate the future.

## 📈 Visual Proof & Business Translation

> _"Stop forcing humans to write glue code that LLMs can generate."_

### Why Business Stakeholders Care:

- **GraphQL & Event-Driven Architecture:** Improves site speed, resulting in direct boosts to Technical SEO and checkout conversion rates.
- **Unified Commerce Protocol:** Lowers total cost of ownership (TCO). You build a plugin once, and all your existing AI agents instantly understand its data structure.
- **Real-Time Insight Engine:** Automates stock anomaly detection, reducing lost revenue and customer support hours.

### Core Components

| Component                   | Role                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SwitchboardOrchestrator** | Central event bus. All data flows through here. Manages plugin registry, validates UCP schemas, emits typed events.                                                 |
| **PosSyncEngine**           | Dedicated POS inventory synchronization. Handles real-time stock updates with conflict resolution and queue deduplication.                                          |
| **WebhookProcessor**        | Validates HMAC signatures, parses vendor-specific payloads, dispatches to the Switchboard. Supports any signature algorithm.                                        |
| **UCP Schema Layer**        | TypeScript interfaces + runtime validators for `UCPProduct`, `UCPInventorySnapshot`, `UCPOrderEvent`, `UCPInsight`. The contract between raw data and AI consumers. |

## 🔌 Build a Plugin in 60 Seconds

Every data source is a plugin. Implement `IGoofRePlugin` — that's the entire contract:

```typescript
import { IGoofRePlugin, UCPProduct, UCPInsight } from '@goofre/core-engine';

export class MyShopPlugin implements IGoofRePlugin {
  readonly id = 'my-shop'; // Unique identifier
  readonly version = '1.0.0';

  /**
   * Transform raw platform product data into a UCP-compliant UCPProduct.
   * This is the only method required for basic product sync.
   */
  async normalizeProduct(raw: MyShopProduct): Promise<UCPProduct> {
    return {
      ucpId: `my-shop::${raw.productId}`,
      sourceId: raw.productId,
      sourcePlatform: 'my-shop',
      title: raw.name,
      description: raw.body_html,
      price: {
        amount: parseFloat(raw.price),
        currency: 'USD',
      },
      inventory: {
        available: raw.inventory_quantity,
        reserved: 0,
        locationId: 'default',
      },
      ucpVersion: '1.0',
      normalizedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  }
}

// Register with the orchestrator
import { SwitchboardOrchestrator } from '@goofre/core-engine';

const orchestrator = new SwitchboardOrchestrator();
orchestrator.registerPlugin(new MyShopPlugin());
```
